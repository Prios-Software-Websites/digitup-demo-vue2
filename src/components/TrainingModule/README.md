# Training Modules

## Note 1:
There is an extra npm package named vue-draggables used within taskdata.
This one need to be installed through ```npm install --save vuedraggable```

## Note 2: 
This module in particular need to be looked upon again.
But it works for its purpose atm


## Note: By choice, this will be renamed on page as Mapping Tool.
For now it will not be done anything toward the file names, due to lack of time (other projects.)
But are a thing to fix for sure.
